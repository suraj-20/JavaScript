## Q.1 How Javascript works?

- Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded langauage.

- Synchronous single-threaded language means that JavaScript can only execute one command at a time , and in a specific order.

- Everything in JavaScript happens inside a execution context.

- Execution context have two components i.e., Memory or Code.

- Memory stores the key: value payers, or functions() in it, kay: value means that a = 10, and a functions means that the whole function: fn(){..}

- Code execute the commands one by one to get the desired output.

- In memory component it first stores all the variable as undefined if there is a function variable it stores the whole function in it, and when the function invoked it create a new execution context in the code component with both the components.
